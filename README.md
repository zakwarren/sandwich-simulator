# Sandwich Simulator

Design your own hasty, limp sandwich filled with MSG and your
choice of ingredients with this seductive sandwich simulator.

These sweet sandwiches will ignite your hungering taste buds with
promises of limitless avarice. Yet they must remain dormant, lapping
clumsily at the scintillating pixels of your monitor.
